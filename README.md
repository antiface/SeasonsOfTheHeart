* Firstly, I realize that others may have used the title "Seasons of The Heart" before; the concept isn't new;
* What's new is my unique way of interpreting what I find most relevant, all year long, in music, painting, and in prose-poetry, and __*research*__ also!;
* Ergo, I am working on a new album of pieces mainly for piano and organ, but also works for guitar;
* I am also going through the __*ARCHIVE*__ and finding what I think is most appropriate for the *Moment*, and publishing it online on various networks/sites;
* I am currently on a *winter hiatus* and working on about 40 new works of visual art, *flat pieces* on paper with *collage elements* subdued color palette;

*__GENERAL OUTLINE OF THE OVERARCHING SEASONS OF THE HEART PROJECT__*:

In the realm of secular spirituality, the essence of human existence is akin to meditation, a continuous engagement with the depths of one's being and the world around them. Within this framework, "man is meditation," signifying a perpetual journey of introspection and connection with the essence of existence.

"Seasons of The Heart" represents a secular liturgical cycle, a year-long celebration of human creativity and cultural heritage. Rather than focusing on traditional religious practices, this secular liturgy revolves around the dissemination of cultural artifacts and innovations that embody the ideals of Beauty, Goodness, and Truth—a Cultural Treasure passed down through generations.

In this secular liturgy, the term "mission" takes on a broader meaning, encompassing the dissemination and diffusion of cultural artifacts and works across the land. The mission of "Seasons of The Heart" is to spread the Cultural Treasure far and wide, ensuring its faithful transmission from one generation to the next. This mission is essential for the sustenance of human civilization, as the Cultural Treasure lies at the very core of what it means to be human.

Each season within the "Seasons of The Heart" cycle corresponds to a distinct quality of time, offering a diverse array of artistic works that resonate with the moral temperature readings of everyday life. These works serve as reflections of the human experience, capturing the nuances of different temporalities and enriching the fabric of cultural expression.

Drawing inspiration from the secular liturgy of "Seasons of The Heart," individuals are invited to engage with the Cultural Treasure in meaningful ways, fostering a deeper appreciation for the richness of human creativity and the interconnectedness of all things. Through this ongoing meditation on cultural artifacts and works, humanity can continue to evolve and thrive, grounded in the enduring legacy of its collective wisdom and expression.
